# CodeAlpha_Music_Recommendation_System
Task-1 

##Overview
**The CodeAlpha** Music Recommendation System aims to provide personalized music recommendations to users based on their preferences and listening history. By analyzing user behavior and music features, the system suggests tracks, albums, or playlists that users are likely to enjoy.

##Features
Personalized Recommendations:
The system analyzes user listening history, favorite genres, and explicit preferences to generate personalized recommendations.
-**Collaborative Filtering:**
-Utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to recommend music based on similar users’ preferences.
Requirements
To run this project, you’ll need the following libraries and tools:

pandas
scikit-learn
spotipy (Python library for the Spotify API)
numpy
matplotlib
Spotify Developer Account (to access the Spotify API)
You can install most of these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas scikit-learn spotipy numpy matplotlib

Additionally, obtain your own Spotify Developer credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) to use the Spotify API.

Data Collection
The project uses song data from Spotify, including audio features and track details. It combines local and Spotify datasets for a broader recommendation system.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing includes feature scaling and selecting relevant audio features for recommendation.

Spotify API
The project accesses the Spotify API to fetch additional data for song recommendation.

Recommendation Function
The recommendation function takes a list of songs and suggests similar tracks based on their audio features and characteristics.

How to Use
To use this recommendation system, provide a list of songs, and it will suggest tracks that are similar in terms of audio features and characteristics. Make sure to replace your Spotify Developer credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) in the code to access the Spotify API.
